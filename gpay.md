# Some ideas on how this wallet can help an individual with their spending behaviour:

> ### Round-Up Transactions

- > Round up transaction into a savings pocket, select the pocket
- > Ask everytime - remember the leftover money from all transactions, save them to a pocket after each payment or at once
- > Transfer spare change into savings pockets when it reaches a least amount like ₹100 instead of settling it every time
- > Selection to save spare change during every transaction in order to skip the UPI pin later for saving changes
- > Set a pocket as a primary spare change pocket

> ### Vendor Loyalty Programmes

> Vendors can run loyalty programmes like the next time you buy you get Gwallet rewards to achieve those savings goals

> With the rewards types now being extended to their saving goals, users are much motivated to save more and vendors to sell more

> # Exploration of these ideas through a design of integrating wallet into GPay directly, here all the ideas take only Gpay as the payment application

Google on Wednesday launched its digital wallet in India with local integrations, nearly two years after the app was [relaunched as a digital wallet platform](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/11/google-launches-google-wallet/) in the U.S. I was curious whether indian users would want to adopt to a digital wallet since tap to pay is a very popular interaction in the US. But how would that behaviour be observed in India and how can Google wallet be ready to this change and don’t end up as another unused app in users phones.

### Why would Indians adopt digital wallets?

Digital payment apps already penetrated into everyone’s lives proving that everyone is open to technology even though there’s risk involved(unintended big transactions) so adopting a new wallet feature is plausible

A Physical wallet has the threat of being stolen or hard to carry around whereas a digital wallet can provide the same if available with much more interesting features

To maintain a leadership position in the digital payments space, Google Pay can enhance its platform with AI-driven personalisation.

Intrinsic Motivation

Extrinsic Motivation

**Some UPI transactions literary review to make a case for integrating Gpay+Wallet which I think is very beneficial in the indian market:**

459.20 Mn monthly transactions made via UPI in the month of May 2024 in India according to NPCI data.

279.63 Mn users registered on Digilocker

Google want to keep wallet as a non payment app but the loyalty that they focus a lot in the current app is much better in the parent apps and Gpay also has an loyalty part(rewards and scratch cards) to their business.

Can google wallet become the smart finance companion for your Gpay where it tells you what are your spending behaviours and how to make habits to meet your financial goals. Help plan your career with smart choices and provide an option to enter the expenses for the month before your salary date. create micro wallets for saving automatically that doesn’t let you take out the money.

What are the popular digital wallet behaviours in India:

・Paying via UPI, Scan and pay(Phone pay, G Pay, Paytm)

・Fastag payment for quick toll pay and go

・Tap and pay by credit/debit card in restaurants

・UPI Lite/Wallets inside UPI apps, pay without entering PIN

Indians have a very sacred behaviour when it comes to money, which is they don’t generally trust any finance app quickly unless it’s a popular app or it is used by freinds & family. This also comes from the attitude towards how we treat money. But UPI has become very popular for quick payments.

#### **Observations from Google Wallet android app:**

I recently used Google wallet app for the first time in a friends phone. Google wallet has the home page with options like Loyalty, add boarding passes or flight tickets from pictures and also let’s you add metro ticket service providers and some automatic functions like ‘Add to google wallet’ in android phones which I didn’t notice this time but I was aware of. Basic principle of any google product you use like Gpay is that it communicates what it does very simply like the QR code scanner which tells me it’ll let me scan and make payments and other features for any payment related app. But this is missing in the wallet app. Common indian users behaviour when it comes to digital wallets that I noticed is the scanning and storing of documents digitally on cloud so that they can access it quickly anytime, anywhere. When andorid phones were first launched and iPhones weren’t a thing a lot of people used to scan documents via camscanner and in colleges I noticed they used it for storing notes and textbooks also.

- Are loyalty cards the primary concern for this user group, do indians save a lot of loyalty cards. Already the parent comapnies of these loyalty cards have their own apps and it makes sense for someone to use PVP app rather than google wallet because I can also book tickets and see quick rewards that can be redeemed. The loyalty saving behaviour is priamrily popular among the US user base.
- Google wallet home screen doesn’t have a quick cam opener for documents scanning. Event the competitor apps like folio and camscanner in this space allow this basic functionality. When it comes to iPhone users notes allow to do this.
- Store documents like driving license, aadhar card, pan card, vote id, passport and some educational certificates like degrees, transfer certificates etc.,
- Organise documents in a easily accessible and browsable manner(utilising the behavoiur on GDrive and Gmail)
- IRCTC currently doesn’t have an send ticket to gmail option, how can we leverage smart triggers like ‘add to wallet’ or some other techniques where users can share train tickets to family/friends
- Store documents and retrieve them in situations for car owners like RTO, License, Pollution, Insurance. Any smart suggestions here like insurance renewal reminders?
- Use google AI to smartly scan gmail or drive and bring those documents to wallet and organise them based on the content(with keeping user’s privacy in mind)
- Digital keys integration with JioTag bluetooth tracker, create an self produced bluetooth hardware for tracking your cars parking spot etc., Create an parking spot tracker using camer for pillar pictures/geo location tags using mobile phone wallet.
- Health document filler for insurances, maintian health docuemnts of your family members in chronoligcal order for future easy access to the consulting doctor and yourself
- Can we create an digital wallet for the metro city users where they can fill petrol using G Wallet and earn rewards. Book an petrol filling slot to avoid long queues and waiting times when they are hurrying to their work and avoid scolding from their grumpy boss.
- Corporate identity saver and physical card replaced with digital, no need to worry about not carrying your ID card
- Save digital addresses/signatures(user centric not geo centric) [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tiNxRJr8eyE3x_mwYxUTckWWFC1ST5fi5Cl3VF_JwQw/edit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tiNxRJr8eyE3x_mwYxUTckWWFC1ST5fi5Cl3VF_JwQw/edit)
- Maintain khatas like everyday Tea at a shop with Gpay integration. Create accounts for frequent transactions like tea & coffee. Set a monthly topup which will be shown in your payment types. This can be UPI pin free and maybe save the merchant also there.

- Save payslip documents, resumes(create/update) with smart PDF compressor and convertor for job applications. Use Google AI to write smart applications based on user intent. Select documents and click share to an HR with smart application writer.

**New user interview questions to expand on:**

- What daily small value transactions do you make and how do you pay them?
- Do you have safety concerns when it comes to your hard copies/documents because you can either lose them or get stolen
- Do you experience network issues during these transactions
- What other hurdles do you experience when you are doing micro transactions
- Vendor-How do you handle minor losses or failed transactions? Customer-How do you get out of any such situation?
- Vendor-Do you ask neighbouring shop owner to receive payments on your behalf and how do you settle it?
- What are your thoughts on Account Aggregator apps and data leakage? What measures would help you feel more secure?
- Would you prefer paying in cash or through UPI? Why or Why not?
- Do you remember the transactions history in your payment app, what do you use it the most for?

### User Personas

**Frequent Traveller**

Travels very often for work or personal reasons. Need to access identity documents, boarding passes, credit cards and other documents on the go. Any gate change information updation to escape the confusion of missing the right gate.

**Chai Lover**

Does micro transactions on a daily basis at tea stall. Might not be aware of UPI lite or offline wallets. If aware maybe not ready to commit to the preloading. Do not want google to know about smoking habits but needs a quick access to his merchant that he pays daily.

**Good organiser without OCD**

Travels to work daily through tolls and might need documents related to insurance and pollution very quickly. Has all the folders setup in cloud like drive or dropbox or maybe gmail itself, need smoother onboarding without needing to find the documents. Quick and easy finding and browsing for educational certificates or payslips when applying to an job interview.

**Data is king**

Is very concerned about self data being thrown into hands of hackers or to agencies that aren’t trustable. Need secure, safe storage and retrieval of personal data without hindering the process of auto filling because it still saves time everyday. Doesn’t trust systems very quickly.

**Loyal to Brands**

Maintains a good record of all loyalty cards and need to know what’s the balance and rewards every now and then. Need to take smarter decisions before making any purchase using these loyalty points.

**UX Concerns**

- adoption
- frequency of usage
- merits
- challenges
- perceptions about the user interface
- overall interaction with digital payments

### **Some early stage wireframes:**

Document Storage

::Master management::

Users can master manage their transactions by grouping them together into buckets of expenses. User can swipe left on a transaction and start selecting transactions. They can name this transaction bucket. The total of the bucket shows on the right similar to the month bucket. However the month’s total will also show.

**::Payment shortcuts::**

Most of the payments that are small value are paying for tea etc. These payments although have small financial value but has the most time spent on these payment apps. Low network or No network issues play a vital role here. Although the UPI lite solves this issue there’s still the amount entering step which is a repetitive process everyday for the user. These are mostly made to the same merchant outside your office or near your house. Having these payment shortcuts for for frequent transactions can reduce the time spent from scanning to completing the payment.

which time of the day and how are you spending, more or less?

**Designing for User Trust:**

- Establish authenticity to gain trust. The rise in online digital frauds and data leaks makes users skeptical about sharing information on new platforms especially when they involve the movement of money.
- Provide contextual information.
- Nudge to make relevant choices.
- Enable personal data sharing/privacy controls. The fear of over leveraging the data (i.e) sharing more data than required and the other one being data abuse (i.e) the fear of misusing the data for non-stated purposes.

**What is the customer journey in Google wallet:**
