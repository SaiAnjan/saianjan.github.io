              I worked on Microsoft defender for protecting mobile devices as
              part of my 8 week internship at India Development centre,
              Hyderabad. Here are few experiences from the internship:

              1. Microsoft research is very good and valuable. They have been
              researching with several products and their use cases. Their
              failure and success test data is useful for several other things.
              Because I’ve seen how valuable research wealth is for design I
              decided during the internship I’ll try and work on a research
              project in my P2 and P3.

              2. There’s this syndrome of designer supremacy that I carried
              during my first employment and I had the same moment again at my
              internship. The PM’s briefed me about the user personas and use
              cases and asked me to start designing screens for those. I was
              arguing with them about the user personas and how they have
              decided without a contextual enquiry but then I sat with the PM’s
              and saw how the user personas that they found were also sufficient
              for shipping the first version. These discussions helped me
              realise that PM’s have been seeing these users and the problem
              area for an year and how time is important in an agile setup.

              3. We had three design reviews with the design studio at the
              internship. This included sr.Des managers and product designers
              and the design heads. During my mid review my mentor told me
              “Anjan, you need to tell a better story”. Post that we had a
              storytelling workshop by a senior at Microsoft. He told us how the
              audience lose the interest with data on a screen and find it
              exciting when you narrate it. After my final review my manager
              told me my storytelling was better than the previous review. One
              of the happiest outcomes of the final review was the principal
              designer of Microsoft Edge asked me If I can present my deck to
              her team.

              4. One of the biggest challenge for me during my internship was
              writing a UX Research report. I was assigned the task of designing
              iOS and android screens. But, I wanted to investigate the other
              areas of vulnerabilities and threats by talking to the users. But
              my research insights needed to be documented well along with the
              design suggestions. I approached my design manager and told him
              that this has been a blocker for long time and he arranged a
              session with a researcher in the team. She taught me what are the
              important pointers in writing a research report. The biggest
              takeaway from that discussion was “Your report should be written
              in a way that data & cyber security should be understood by a 5
              year old kid”. While I haven’t learnt how to write a report better
              I’m planning to do that this period at IDC.

              5. Microsoft as a organisation pushes everyone towards inclusivity
              and diversity. We had a one week intern learning session where
              they had a painting session and another session where they taught
              us the Accessibility sign language. During my internship I had
              access to Microsoft research and everyone in the organisation
              reached out to us personally if we have any blockers with subject
              matter or any knowledge. We had a sessions with the designers
              where they shared their design journey with us and we got to see
              how they experienced design as part of their profession. There
              were engineers and music enthusiasts who turned out as designers.
              Sessions like these inspired us for dreaming more. During this
              sessions also I met a lot of IDC alumni and we talked about
              professors at IDC. I personally felt the importance of IDC during
              the internship and I would try and utilise my time here at IDC
              this year to make most of it.

              6. After the internship I’m writing more notes in my mobile and
              I’m planning my work through reminders. This habit was the
              influence of the unorganised work that I had done during my
              initial stages of my internship and I intend to plan my work
              properly from this semester.

              7. During my internship I also decided to work more on how to
              convert research data into design ideas. I was also critically
              looking at fonts that Microsoft products use(Thanks to Dalvi sir’s
              course). After my PPO interview at my internship I wanted to think
              about what my immediate career position should be. Although I
              didn’t get the offer I started thinking about should I be a UX
              Designer or a Design researcher.

              8. One of the technical skills I picked up from the internship is
              Swift code development in Xcode. I’ve seen how to transform
              designs to screens and I developed few of the screens myself. I
              had UI sanity sessions with the engineering team and I realised
              how important is Adaptivity and Layout is important in UI Design.

              9. One of the important things that helped us with our internship
              is the connect with the mentors. We had 3 connects with the
              mentors where we define our core priorities for the internship and
              at every connect we defined what we could have done better for an
              better business impact and what my work has helped the team and
              what I intend to do in future. This helped us realise our goals
              for every period and helped us develop our performance along each
              period. Something like this at IDC with the professors would help
              us know what have we done till now and what we should do moving
              forward.
