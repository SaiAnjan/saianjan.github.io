    <p class="f6 fw3 mb4 gray">
      My journey with digital payments took a challenging turn when I recently managed both my and my sister’s savings—around five lakhs—in a single account. Confident in my budgeting skills, I relied on digital payments through UPI apps. But over time, the ease of these transactions led me to overspend, unintentionally depleting the savings. This personal experience highlighted the subtle behavioral shift digital payments can cause, pushing me to explore ways to support users in more mindful spending.
    </p>

    <p class="f6 fw3 mb4 gray">
      In India, UPI has already established a seamless, cashless experience, and many users rely on it for everyday transactions. Introducing a digital wallet alongside UPI is an ambitious move, especially since wallet usage is largely a Western behavior. Indian users tend to prefer direct, bank-linked payments, with many feeling that a separate wallet adds complexity. However, I see an opportunity here to bridge this gap by tailoring Google Wallet for Indian users, focusing on trust, simplicity, and financial education.
    </p>

    <p class="f6 fw3 mb4 pb3 bb b--black-10 gray">
      This case study addresses the unique factors influencing Indian users’ adoption of digital wallets. My goal is to create a solution that doesn’t just provide convenience but actively supports healthier financial behaviors in an emerging digital economy.

      Insights from Microsoft Research
    </h3>
    <p class="f6 fw3 gray mv4">
      During my internship at Microsoft, I discovered the immense value of research. Microsoft’s rigorous testing across products, both successful and failed, provided a wealth of knowledge that was pivotal for design iterations. Observing this firsthand, I decided to focus on research-driven design in my P2 and P3, aiming to build upon this vast research foundation.

      Balancing Design and Agile: Lessons in Collaboration
    </h3>
    <p class="f6 fw3 gray mv4">
      At first, I struggled with what I called “designer supremacy,” where I questioned the user personas provided by the PMs. I believed that without a contextual inquiry, the personas would lack depth. However, after sitting down with the PMs and reviewing the user data, I realized they had a solid understanding of the users and the time constraints within the agile environment. This experience taught me the importance of balancing thorough design practices with practical constraints.

      Storytelling in Design: A Key to Engagement
    </h3>
    <p class="f6 fw3 gray mv4">
      One of the most valuable pieces of feedback I received during my internship was, “Anjan, you need to tell a better story.” After a mid-review, I attended a storytelling workshop led by a senior at Microsoft. I learned how to engage the audience better by narrating data, rather than just presenting it. The improvement in my storytelling was noted during my final review, and the principal designer of Microsoft Edge even asked me to present my deck to her team.

      Writing a UX Research Report: From Struggle to Clarity
    </h3>
    <p class="f6 fw3 gray mv4">
      Writing a UX research report was a significant challenge for me. I wanted to explore vulnerabilities and threats by conducting user interviews, but documenting these insights proved difficult. After expressing my concerns, my design manager connected me with a researcher who simplified the process: “Your report should be understandable by a 5-year-old.” This session transformed my approach to research documentation, and I plan to enhance these skills during my time at IDC.

      Inclusivity and Diversity at Microsoft: More than Just Words
    </h3>
    <p class="f6 fw3 gray mv4">
      Microsoft's commitment to inclusivity and diversity was evident throughout my internship. We participated in an intern learning session, where we explored accessibility sign language and shared experiences with designers from diverse backgrounds. These sessions inspired me to dream bigger and taught me how inclusivity can shape design in meaningful ways.

      From Chaos to Organization: Building Better Work Habits
    </h3>
    <p class="f6 fw3 gray mv4">
      At the start of my internship, my work was disorganized, but this experience helped me cultivate better work habits. Since then, I’ve begun relying on notes and reminders to structure my workflow. I aim to carry this sense of organization forward into my future projects.

      Research to Design: Bridging the Gap
    </h3>
    <p class="f6 fw3 gray mv4">
      During the internship, I focused on converting research insights into tangible design ideas. Thanks to Professor Dalvi’s course, I also became more critical of the fonts used in Microsoft products. After my PPO interview, I began considering whether my future lies in UX design or design research, although I haven’t finalized that decision yet.

      Gaining Technical Skills: Swift Development
    </h3>
    <p class="f6 fw3 gray mv4">
      I picked up valuable technical skills during my time at Microsoft, particularly in Swift code development within Xcode. I worked with the engineering team to transform designs into fully functional screens. These experiences underscored the importance of layout and adaptivity in UI design, especially in cross-platform environments.

      Mentor Connects: Defining Core Priorities
    </h3>
    <p class="f6 fw3 gray mv2">
      Throughout the internship, I had multiple mentor connects, where we discussed priorities and evaluated the impact of my work. These sessions helped me reflect on how I could have improved my contributions and set goals for future growth. I believe a similar system at IDC, where regular feedback is shared with professors, could help guide our progress.
